NAME

Acme::Pythonic::Functions - Python-like functions for Perl

This Perl-module offers some basic string-, list- and other functions, that try to mimic those of the programming-language "Python".

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make

and as "root":

	make install

USAGE

Python-like functions, that can be found here, are:

    Strings:

        endswith()
        isdigit()
        isin()
        len()
        lstrip()
        replace()
        rstrip()
        startswith()
        strip()

    Lists:

        append()
        extend()
        insert()
        isin()
        len()
        remove()

    Hashes:

        has_key()
        isin()
        len()

    Files:

        isdir()
        isfile()
        listdir(), oslistdir()

    System:
        osname()

    print-Replacement:
        pront()

Please see the scripts in the "examples"-directory in the tar-ball about how to use them.

There are a few additional (hopefully useful) functions that don't have a model in Python.
